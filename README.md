# BeamMP Join Message
A simple plugin that notifies players when another player joins the server.

It'll output a message in the server chat, show a notification in the top left corner of the screen and also play a sound.

Feel free to change, modify or disable features to your liking.

### How to package:
* server/* -> Resources/Server/joinmessage
* client/* -> Resources/Client/joinmessage.zip

Need 7-Zip installed to run `reload.ps1`
